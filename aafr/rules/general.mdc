- Always write clean, modular, and PEP8-compliant Python code.
- Use descriptive variable and function names that clearly express intent (e.g., detect_indication_structure, calculate_cvd_alignment).
- All modules must include docstrings explaining purpose, inputs, and outputs.
- Include inline comments for all key logic, especially financial or mathematical calculations.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies — use standard Python libraries unless justified.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over brevity.

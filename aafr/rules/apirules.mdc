- Always use the Tradovate Demo API base URL for testing:
  https://demo.tradovateapi.com
- Never expose client ID, secret, or credentials in code output.
- Implement a safe fallback (mock data loader) when API is unavailable.
- All API interactions must be wrapped in try/except blocks with graceful error messages.
- Keep environment switching simple:
  MODE=demo or MODE=live loads from config.json automatically.
